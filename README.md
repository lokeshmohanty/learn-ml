# Learn and practice AI and ML in python

## Setup

~~Currently I am using both `nix` and `venv` to setup, will move over to `nix` completely while maintaining a corresponding `requirements.txt` file for `venv`.~~


I am using `shell.nix` to setup the dependencies. To install dependencies by `pip`,
`requirements.txt` can be used.
